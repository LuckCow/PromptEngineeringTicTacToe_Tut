Act as my opponent in the game of tic-tac-toe. Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces on the grid with either an ' X' or an ' O' until one player has three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Rules of tic-tac-toe:
    The game is played on a 3x3 grid called the board. The tic-tac-toe board is represented by a 3 by 3 grid of characters. Each cell is represented by either ' X' for Player 1's moves, ' O' for Player 2's moves, and ' _' for a blank cell.
    There are two players: Player 1 (who plays with ' X') and Player 2 (who plays with ' O').
    The game starts with an empty grid.
    Player 1 goes first and places an ' X' in an empty cell on the grid.
    Player 2 goes next and places an ' O' in an empty cell on the grid.
    Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
    A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

Starting the game:
	Before the game starts, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2. Then, if I am Player 1, start off by showing the empty board. If I am Player 2, start off by placing your move onto the empty board.

Response format:
	During the game, I will copy the current state of the board, place my move, and send you the new board with my move in it.
	Then, for your response, you need to follow this sequence: check that my move was legal, output the current board updated with my move, check if the game is over, and if not, make your move and output that board before finally checking if the game is over once again. These steps are further outlined below:
	1. Check that my move was a legal move. This means that there should only be one more move added and that is from the correct player. Additionally, none of the previously placed letters can be moved from where they were in the last position. If my move has any of these moves has any of these mistakes, you must halt the game, explain how the move was invalid, then output the your updated board from just before the illegal move was attempted. Otherwise, carry out the next steps and proceed normally.
	2. Repeating the current board state.
	3. Check to see if the game is over and tell me if it is.
	4. Play your move by outputting the next board state that shows your next move. When making your move, always try to make the best possible move. Refer to the Optimal Strategy section to figure out what the best move to make is.
	5. Check to see if the game is over and indicate if it is over or if I should move again.

Optimal Strategy:
In order to find the best move, You must analyze the board as described below and ultimately output the new board with the best move applied to it. The first thing you need to do is output the classifications of each dimension (meaning row, column, and diagonal). This is a 3 step process:
1. Output the contents of each dimension
Each cell within the tic-tac-toe board is numbered from 1 to 9 going left to right and top to bottom. Each dimension always contains the letter from the same set of 3 cells shown below. For example, when showing the contents of Diagonal 2, always copy the letters from cell numbers 3, 5, and 7. When outputting the contents of each dimension, use the reference below as a guide. For each dimension, substitute the cell number with the actual content of the cell in the given board.

Cell Numbers Board Reference:
 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9

Dimension to Cell Number Reference:
Row 1: " 1 2 3"
Row 2: " 4 5 6"
Row 3: " 7 8 9"
Column 1: " 1 4 7"
Column 2: " 2 5 8"
Column 3: " 3 6 9"
Diagonal 1: " 1 5 9"
Diagonal 2: " 3 5 7"

	The row numbers go from top to bottom. Within each row, the order should be from left to right. The columns numbers go from left to right. Within the column, the letter order goes from top to bottom. Diagonal 1 goes from the top left to the bottom right. This means that it has the top left, middle, and bottom right cells (cells number 1, 5, and 9). Diagonal 2 goes from the top right to bottom left. This means that it has the bottom left, middle, and top right cells, which are cells number 3, 5, and 7. It is important not to mix up the order of the letters within the dimension. In order to show the contents of the dimensions follow this transformation scheme outlined below.

2. Count each letter type within the dimension:
	Please count the number of letters in the dimension sequence. Each dimension will have 3 letters outputted from step 1, and I need you to count how many times each character occurs in that sequence. There are only 3 characters that are possible in the sequence: ' X', ' O', and ' _'. For example: given the sequence " X X _", the counts should be " X: 2 O: 0 _:1"
3. Classify dimensions based on their counts:
	The four possible classifications are 'possible O', 'possible X', 'open', and 'closed'. The 'possible O' category means that there are two O's and an empty cell and no X's. This means that if the counts are "X:0 O:2 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'possible X' for when there are two X's and an empty cell and no O's. This means that if the counts are " X:2 O:0 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'open' category means that there are one or less X or O within the dimension. This means that if the counts are of the blank cells are greater than or equal to 2, it will always be in the category 'open'. The 'closed' category means that there is atleast one X and atleast one O. This means that if the counts of both X and O are greater than or equal to 1, it will always be the 'closed' category.

Now it is time to select the best move based on this dimension analysis. The output should follow this format but replace all of the square brackets with the actual answers based on the analysis. "Best Move for Player [X or O]: Category: [best category], Dimension: [best dimension], Cell: #[1, 2, or 3], Coordinate: ([row], [column])". Each part to fill in is important for figuring out how to fill in the next part. First, just reiterate which player we are trying to make a move for. This is used to select the best dimension category. The best dimension is determined by following this simple priority system. First, check if there is a 'possible' win in for the player from the prompt. This means if the player being asked about is 'X', 'possible X' is the priority over 'possible O' for the number one priority. Conversely, if the prompt is for Player O, then 'possible O' is the priority over 'possible X' for the number one priority. If there is, make a move in the blank cell in this dimension to win the game. Next, check if there is a 'possible' win for the other player. If there is, then make a move in this column in order to block the other player from winning (but only if you cannot win yourself). If there are none of these categories, then move in the first available 'open' dimension. Finally, if no other options are available, make a move in the first empty cell within a 'closed' dimension. Once the best category is selected, identify the number of the cell that is blank in that dimension. Finally, we need to translate the empty cell number in the selected dimension back to where it belongs on the board. Output the coordinate in terms of (row, column) that corresponds to the blank cell in the selected dimension. For example, if the selected dimension is column 2 and the contents are ' _ X X', the cell number would be 1 since it is the first cell that is blank. The coordinates of the move translate to (1, 3) since it is the first row and the third column. More generally, if the selected dimension is a row, then the corrdinates are simply the row number then the cell number. If the selected dimension is a column, then the first number in the corrdinate would be the cell number and the second number would be the column number.

Finally, use the coordinate chosen to place the move on the board and output the board with the best move place on it.

For example, when I give the prompt:
"""
Player O
 _ _ _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

You should output exactly:
"""
Dimensions:
Row 1: " _ _ _" Counts "X:0 O:0 _:3" Classification: 'open'
Row 2: " X O X" Counts "X:2 O:1 _:0" Classification: 'closed'
Row 3: " _ O X" Counts "X:1 O:1 _:1" Classification: 'closed'
Column 1: " _ X _" Counts "X:1 O:0 _:2" Classification: 'open'
Column 2: " _ O O" Counts "X:0 O:2 _:1" Classification: 'possible O'
Column 3: " _ X X" Counts "X:2 O:0 _:1" Classification: 'possible X'
Diagonal 1: " _ O X" Counts "X:1 O:1 _:1" Classification: 'closed'
Diagonal 2: " _ O _" Counts "X:0 O:1 _:2" Classification: 'open'

Best Move for Player O: Category: 'possible O', Dimension: Column 2, Cell: #1, Coordinate: (1, 2)

Resulting Board:
 _ O _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

Additional Notes:
	Continuity is very important. You must use the game state exactly as it is presented and not modify it in any way other than adding your move. Additionally, you must remember which player you are and only play a move by adding the letter corresponding to your player. Once the game is over, ask me if I would like to play another game. Please be consistent and stay on track facilitating the game as described above.

	If you understand, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2.
