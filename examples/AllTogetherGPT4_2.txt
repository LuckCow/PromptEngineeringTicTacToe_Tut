Here is the shortened prompt attempt where GPT fails at selecting the corner for the first move and then misclassified the cell number but then stopped itself from making the resulting illegal move.

Act as my opponent in the game of tic-tac-toe.

Rules of tic-tac-toe:
    The game is played on a 3x3 grid called the board. The tic-tac-toe board is represented by a 3 by 3 grid of characters. Each cell is represented by either ' X' for Player 1's moves, ' O' for Player 2's moves, and ' _' for a blank cell.
	There are two players: Player 1 (' X') and Player 2 (' O').
	The game starts with an empty grid.
	Player 1 goes first and places an ' X' in an empty cell on the grid.
	Player 2 goes next and places an ' O' in an empty cell on the grid.
	Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
	A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
	If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

Starting the game:
	Before the game starts, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2. Then, if I am Player 1, start off by showing the empty board. If I am Player 2, start off by placing your move onto the empty board. There is no need to run the optimal move strategy for the first move. Just go in the middle if it available and if not, choose the top left corner.

Response format:
	During the game, I will copy the current state of the board, place my move, and send you the new board with my move in it.
	Then, for your response, follow this sequence:
	1. Check that my move was a legal move. This means that there should only be one more move added and that is from the correct player. Additionally, none of the previously placed letters can be moved from where they were in the last position. If my move has any of these moves has any of these mistakes, you must halt the game, explain how the move was invalid, then output the your updated board from just before the illegal move was attempted. Otherwise, carry out the next steps and proceed normally.
	2. Repeating the current board state.
	3. Check to see if the game is over and tell me if it is.
	4. Play your move by outputting the next board state that shows your next move. When making your move, always try to make the best possible move. Refer to the Optimal Strategy section to figure out what the best move to make is.
	5. Check to see if the game is over and indicate if it is over or if I should move again.

Optimal Strategy:
In order to find the best move, You must analyze the board as described below and ultimately output the new board with the best move applied to it. The first thing you need to do is output the classifications of each dimension (meaning row, column, and diagonal). This is a 3 step process:
1. Output the contents of each dimension
Each cell within the tic-tac-toe board is numbered from 1 to 9 going left to right and top to bottom. Each dimension always contains the letter from the same set of 3 cells shown below. For example, when showing the contents of Diagonal 2, always copy the letters from cell numbers 3, 5, and 7. When outputting the contents of each dimension, use the reference below as a guide. For each dimension, substitute the cell number with the actual content of the cell in the given board.

Cell Numbers Board Reference:
 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9

Dimension to Cell Number Reference:
Row 1: 1 2 3
Row 2: 4 5 6
Row 3: 7 8 9
Column 1: 1 4 7
Column 2: 2 5 8
Column 3: 3 6 9
Diagonal 1: 1 5 9
Diagonal 2: 3 5 7

2. Count each letter type within the dimension:
	Please count the number of letters in the dimension sequence. Each dimension will have 3 letters outputted from step 1, and I need you to count how many times each character occurs in that sequence. There are only 3 characters that are possible in the sequence: ' X', ' O', and ' _'. For example: given the sequence " X X _", the counts should be " X: 2 O: 0 _:1"
3. Classify dimensions based on their counts:
	The four possible classifications are 'possible O', 'possible X', 'open', and 'closed'. The 'possible O' category means that there are two O's and an empty cell and no X's. This means that if the counts are " X:0 O:2 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'possible X' for when there are two X's and an empty cell and no O's. This means that if the counts are " X:2 O:0 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'open' category means that there are one or less X or O within the dimension. This means that if the counts are of the blank cells are greater than or equal to 2, it will always be in the category 'open'. The 'closed' category means that there is atleast one X and atleast one O. This means that if the counts of both X and O are greater than or equal to 1, it will always be the 'closed' category.

Now it is time to select the best move based on this dimension analysis. The output should follow this format but replace all of the square brackets with the actual answers based on the analysis. "Best Move for Player [X or O]: Category: [best category], Dimension: [best dimension], Cell: [1, 2, or 3], Coordinate: ([row], [column])". Each part to fill in is important for figuring out how to fill in the next part. First, just reiterate which player we are trying to make a move for. This is used to select the best dimension category. The best dimension is determined by following this simple priority system. First, check if there is a 'possible' win in for the player from the prompt. This means if the player being asked about is 'X', 'possible X' is the priority over 'possible O' for the number one priority. Conversely, if the prompt is for Player O, then 'possible O' is the priority over 'possible X' for the number one priority. If there is, make a move in the blank cell in this dimension to win the game. Next, check if there is a 'possible' win for the other player. If there is, then make a move in this column in order to block the other player from winning (but only if you cannot win yourself). If there are none of these categories, then move in the first available 'open' dimension. Finally, if no other options are available, make a move in the first empty cell within a 'closed' dimension. Once the best category is selected, identify the number of the cell that is blank in that dimension. Finally, we need to translate the empty cell number in the selected dimension back to where it belongs on the board. Output the coordinate in terms of (row, column) that corresponds to the blank cell in the selected dimension. For example, if the selected dimension is column 2 and the contents are " _ X X", the cell number would be 1 since it is the first cell that is blank. The coordinates of the move translate to (1, 3) since it is the first row and the third column. More generally, if the selected dimension is a row, then the coordinates are simply the row number then the cell number. If the selected dimension is a column, then the first number in the coordinate would be the cell number and the second number would be the column number.

Finally, use the coordinate chosen to place the move on the board and output the board with the best move place on it.

For example, if it is your turn as player O with the board:
"""
 _ _ _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

You should output exactly this for move analysis section:
"""
Dimensions:
Row 1: _ _ _ Count X:0 O:0 _:3 Classification open
Row 2: X O X Count X:2 O:1 _:0 Classification closed
Row 3: _ O X Count X:1 O:1 _:1 Classification closed
Column 1: _ X _ Count X:1 O:0 _:2 Classification open
Column 2: _ O O Count X:0 O:2 _:1 Classification possible O
Column 3: _ X X Count X:2 O:0 _:1 Classification possible X
Diagonal 1: _ O X Count X:1 O:1 _:1 Classification closed
Diagonal 2: _ O _ Count X:0 O:1 _:2 Classification open

Best Move for Player O: Category: possible O, Dimension: Column 2, Cell: 1, Coordinate: (1, 2)

Resulting Board:
 _ O _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

Additional Notes:
	Continuity is important. The game board should only have a single move applied at a time and any existing move cannot be removed or overwritten. Additionally, you must remember which player you are and only play a move by adding the letter corresponding to your player. Once the game is over, ask me if I would like to play another game.  Make sure to output the board in a code snippet.

	If you understand, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2.

Do you want to be Player 1 or Player 2?
