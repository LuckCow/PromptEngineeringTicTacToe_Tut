Here we make it decently far, but it gets very turned around at the end. It is still within the token limit at <2,819 though.

Act as my opponent in the game of tic-tac-toe.

Rules of tic-tac-toe:
    The game is played on a 3x3 grid called the board. The tic-tac-toe board is represented by a 3 by 3 grid of characters. Each cell is represented by either ' X' for Player 1's moves, ' O' for Player 2's moves, and ' _' for a blank cell.
	There are two players: Player 1 (' X') and Player 2 (' O').
	The game starts with an empty grid.
	Player 1 goes first and places an ' X' in an empty cell on the grid.
	Player 2 goes next and places an ' O' in an empty cell on the grid.
	Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
	Players may only move into a blank cell. If they try to move in an already occupied cell, they must be told to try again until they pick a valid move.
	A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
	If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

Starting the game:
	Before the game starts, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2. Then, if I am Player 1, start off by showing the empty board. If I am Player 2, start off by placing your move onto the empty board. There is no need to run the optimal move strategy for the first move. Just go in the middle if it available and if not, choose the top left corner.

Response format:
	During the game, I will indicate the coordinate of the cell I wish to move in. This coordinate is from 1 to 9. Use the Cell Coordinate Reference to map the cell coordinate number to the cell that the move should go into.
	Then, for your response, follow this sequence:
	1. Check that my move was a legal move. A legal move is one that corresponds with a blank cell. If the cell already has an X or O in it, the move is invalid because it cannot overwrite already existing moves. If the move is invalid, you must halt the game, explain how the move was invalid, then output your updated board from just before the illegal move was attempted. Otherwise, carry out the next steps and proceed normally.
	2. Place the move into the board and output the current state of the board with the new move added in.
	3. Check to see if the game is over and tell me if it is.
	4. Play your move by outputting the next board state that shows your next move. When making your move, always try to make the best possible move. Refer to the Optimal Strategy section to figure out what the best move to make is.
	5. Check to see if the game is over and indicate if it is over or if I should move again.

Optimal Strategy:
In order to find the best move, You must analyze the board as described below and ultimately output the new board with the best move applied to it. If it is the first move of the game, all you need to do is follow this simple rule instead of the whole analysis specified below: if the center cell is open (cell 5), go there, otherwise go in the top corner (cell 1). Otherwise, follow this 4-step process to determine the best move:
1. Output the contents of each dimension
Each cell within the tic-tac-toe board is numbered from 1 to 9 going left to right and top to bottom. These numbers are coordinates which serve to identify each cell when making moves. Each dimension always contains the letter from the same set of 3 cells shown below. For example, when showing the contents of Diagonal 2, always copy the letters from cell numbers 3, 5, and 7. When outputting the contents of each dimension, use the reference below as a guide. For each dimension, substitute the cell number with the actual content of the cell in the given board.

Cell Coordinate Reference:
 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9

Dimension to Cell Number Reference:
Row 1: 1 2 3
Row 2: 4 5 6
Row 3: 7 8 9
Column 1: 1 4 7
Column 2: 2 5 8
Column 3: 3 6 9
Diagonal 1: 1 5 9
Diagonal 2: 3 5 7

2. Count each letter type within the dimension:
	Please count the number of letters in the dimension sequence. Each dimension will have 3 letters outputted from step 1, and I need you to count how many times each character occurs in that sequence. There are only 3 characters that are possible in the sequence: ' X', ' O', and ' _'. For example: given the sequence " X X _", the counts should be " X: 2 O: 0 _:1"
3. Classify dimensions based on their counts:
	The four possible classifications are 'possible O', 'possible X', 'open', and 'closed'. The 'possible O' category means that there are two O's and an empty cell and no X's. This means that if the counts are " X:0 O:2 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'possible X' for when there are two X's and an empty cell and no O's. This means that if the counts are " X:2 O:0 _:1", it will always be in the category 'possible O'. The 'open' category means that there are one or less X or O within the dimension. This means that if the counts are of the blank cells are greater than or equal to 2, it will always be in the category 'open'. The 'closed' category means that there is at least one X and at least one O. This means that if the counts of both X and O are greater than or equal to 1, it will always be the 'closed' category.

4. Now it is time to select the best move based on this dimension analysis. The output should follow this format but replace all the square brackets with the actual answers based on the analysis. "Best Move for Player [X or O]: Category: [best category], Dimension: [best dimension], Coordinate: [cell number]". Each part to fill in is important for figuring out how to fill in the next part. First, just reiterate which player we are trying to make a move for. This is used to select the best dimension category. The best dimension is determined by following this simple priority system. First, check if there is a 'possible' win in for the player from the prompt. This means if the player being asked about is 'X', 'possible X' is the priority over 'possible O' for the number one priority. Conversely, if the prompt is for Player O, then 'possible O' is the priority over 'possible X' for the number one priority. If there is, make a move in the blank cell in this dimension to win the game. Next, check if there is a 'possible' win for the other player. If there is, then make a move in this column in order to block the other player from winning (but only if you cannot win yourself). If there are none of these categories, then move in the first available 'open' dimension. Finally, if no other options are available, make a move in the first empty cell within a 'closed' dimension. Once the best category is selected, identify the number of the cell that is blank in that dimension. Finally, we need to translate the empty cell number in the selected dimension back to where it belongs on the board. Output the coordinate in terms of the cell number that corresponds to the blank cell in the selected dimension. For example, if the selected dimension is column 2 and the contents are " X X _", the coordinate would be 2 since the blank is in the last cell in the dimension which for column 2 is 8. Find the blank in the column and use the Dimension to Cell Number Reference to find the coordinate number identifying that cell.

Finally, use the coordinate chosen to place the move on the board and output the board with the best move place on it.

For example, if it is your turn as player O with the board:
"""
 _ _ _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

You should output exactly this for move analysis section:
"""
Dimensions:
Row 1: _ _ _ Count X:0 O:0 _:3 Classification open
Row 2: X O X Count X:2 O:1 _:0 Classification closed
Row 3: _ O X Count X:1 O:1 _:1 Classification closed
Column 1: _ X _ Count X:1 O:0 _:2 Classification open
Column 2: _ O O Count X:0 O:2 _:1 Classification possible O
Column 3: _ X X Count X:2 O:0 _:1 Classification possible X
Diagonal 1: _ O X Count X:1 O:1 _:1 Classification closed
Diagonal 2: _ O _ Count X:0 O:1 _:2 Classification open

Best Move for Player O: Category: possible O, Dimension: Column 2, Coordinate: 2

Resulting Board:
 _ O _
 X O X
 _ O X
"""

Additional Notes:
Remember which player you are and only play a move by adding the letter corresponding to your player. Once the game is over, ask me if I would like to play another game.  Make sure to output the board in a code snippet.

	If you understand, ask me if I would like to be Player 1 or Player 2.
